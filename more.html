Many of these children could no longer attend their regular schools for fear of retaliation for being “the wrong tribe.” Esther, an early childhood educator, saw an opportunity to serve and initially welcomed a handful of these children into their living room. However, when other parents learned there was a safe place in their neighborhood where their young ones could attend school, the numbers started rising.

Kizimani partnered with Jamii School to help feed the children who arrived at school hungry. The feeding program became a huge draw for poor parents who could not afford the tuition at government schools, and were also struggling to feed their children. Esther and Basilus, both from similar humble backgrounds, believed they had found their calling in offering quality education to the poor and marginalized.
